# Project planning

Turn a fresh project idea into a focused, MVP-first plan that favors prebuilt solutions and opinionated frameworks over custom complexity.

## Workflow

1. Clarify the goal in one sentence and define the single-user MVP boundary: what ships in the first cut, what is explicitly out of scope.
2. Decompose the goal into a small set of manageable tasks. Group by user-visible outcome, not by layer.
3. Research frameworks and libraries that could absorb whole tasks. Prefer pre-built solutions unless a clear constraint rules them out.
4. Start from an official scaffold or starter via `bunx create-*` instead of hand-rolling the project skeleton.
5. Before any dependency install in the new project, create or preserve `bunfig.toml` with `[install] minimumReleaseAge = 259200`. Prefer scaffold flags that skip the initial install, then run `bun install`.
6. Pick an opinionated framework (e.g. Next.js, TanStack Start) when it improves organization. Skip framework-grade tooling for one-screen utilities.
7. For UI, initialize shadcn/ui with a minimalist preset. Pull in components on demand.
8. Lay out components and services in a logical structure before any code is written.
9. Decide the minimum useful testing surface and the minimum useful git-hook surface. Both default to small.
10. Produce a short plan: goal, MVP scope, task list, stack choices with one-line rationale, deferred items.

## Planning rules

* Build for one user first.
* Use Bun as the runtime, package manager, and script runner by default.
* Start every new project from an official scaffold via `bunx create-*`.
* Every Bun project must include a root `bunfig.toml` with `minimumReleaseAge = 259200` under `[install]` before `bun install` or `bun add`.
* For UI, default to shadcn/ui with a minimalist preset.
* Prefer prebuilt over bespoke. Choose boring, well-documented defaults.
* Cut features before cutting clarity.
* Pick one opinionated framework per project.
* Organize by feature or domain once there is more than one screen.
* Write tests for critical logic and infrastructure only.
* Use git hooks for formatting and fast static checks only.
* Defer anything not on the path to a working MVP.
* Re-evaluate the plan once the first end-to-end slice runs.

## Output shape

Write `PLAN.md` in the app directory with:

- Goal in one sentence
- Single-user MVP + explicit outs
- Outcome-oriented task list (vertical slices)
- Stack with one-line rationale each
- Deferred items and why
